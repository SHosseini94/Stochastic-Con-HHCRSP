"""
It saves all the information related to an instance. In an instance, the number of new patients and available aides are determined. 
    The information contains:
        1. instance _name: the name of instance presents the number of new patients in this instance 
        2. number patient: the total number of patients 
        3. number aide: the total number of aides
        4. horizon: the number of planning days 
        5. number node: the summation of number of patients+ 2* number aides 
        6. list patient: this list keeps all the patients information, which means each item in the list associates with one patient object from Patient Class 
        7. list aide: this list keeps all the aides information, which means each item in the list associates with one aide object from Aide Class 
        8. list feasible per aide: a list for each aide keeps the list of all feasible patients set assigned to it, each feasible assignment is a kind of string contain the id of patients assigned to it, for example 23-24-25 could be a record of this list 
        9. list feasible day per aide: a list for each aide keeps the list of all feasible patients set assigned to it for each day, each feasible assignment is a kind of string contain the id of patients assigned to it and also the id of day, for example 23-24-25-/0
        10. distance_matrix: a squared matrix of distances between nodes
